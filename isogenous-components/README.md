This code accompanies the paper _Families of split Jacobians with isogenous components_ (JTNB).

It is organized as follows:
- _general_strategy.m_ contains code that outputs the irreducible components of *S<sub>n</sub>(N)*, which defined in ยง3. It also verifies geometric irreducibility and computes the genera of the irreducible components (works over **Q** for *n*=2, but for *n*=3, there is a component of *S*<sub>3</sub>(2) that is reducible over **Q**(sqrt(-3)) and there is also a component that does not correspond to a family of genus-2 curves). 
- _isogeny_induced_isogeny.m_ contains code that outputs the content of Table 1 and Table 2. It can also be used to empirically verify Propositions 2.9 and 2.10.
- _extra_splittings.m_ verifies the results of ยง4.4, showing that various curves described in the paper have a Jacobian that is not only (2,2)- or (3,3)- split, but also (*n*,*n*)- split for other values of *n*. This is based on the work of A.Kumar https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2849.
- The folders (2,2) and (3,3) contain code that verifies that various curves *C* described in the paper that have a (2,2)- or (3,3)- split Jacobian are such that the Jacobian has *N*-isogenous components for specific values of *N*, as claimed in the paper.
