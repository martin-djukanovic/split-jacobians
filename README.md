This is a repository of various code I have written in Magma for the purpose of investigating curves of genus 2 whose Jacobians are (n,n)-isogenous to a product of two elliptic curves.
If you wish to cite this repository, please cite the corresponding publication, if applicable.

The code was last tested with Magma V2.28-4.
