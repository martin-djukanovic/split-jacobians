These files contain equations satisfied by the Igusa-Clebsch invariants of a genus-two curve with an (n,n)-split Jacobian.
For a given n, the equation defines a surface that is a double cover of the moduli space of such genus-two curves; this is because
the equations are obtained under the assumption that the two n-to-1 covers C -> E and C -> E' of elliptic curves are distinguishable.
The resulting surface has an involution corresponding to swapping E and E'.
