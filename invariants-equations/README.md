These files contain equations satisfied by the Igusa-Clebsch invariants of a genus-two curve with an _(n,n)_-split Jacobian.
For a given _n_, the equation defines a surface that is a double cover of the moduli space of such genus-two curves; this is because
the equations are obtained under the assumption that the two n-to-1 covers _C_ → _E_ and _C_ → _E'_ of elliptic curves are distinguishable.
The resulting surface has an involution corresponding to swapping _E_ and _E'_.
